    <h1>Flexes at the Desk</h1>
    <br>

   Around the country more students and teachers are now working from home 
   and mental and physical wellness is declining while our bodies adjust to new 
   living enviroments. Being at home can reduce activity by providing more 
   distractions and leisure activities such as enjoying a snack or indulging in social media 
   applications. Along with distractions and daily obligations, self-care is being  
   neglicted and it's having negative affects on mood and productivity.  
   Luckily, simple reminders and encouragement can help students and 
   home office workers to get up and get active!
