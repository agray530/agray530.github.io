            Sullen sighs and head-to-keyboard contact aren't the breathing or 
        stretching techniques the body ideally needs to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
        Around the country more and more students and teachers are now working from home 
        and mental and physical wellness is declining while our bodies adjust to new 
        working enviroments. Being at home can reduce physical activity by providing more 
        distractions and leisure activities such as, enjoying a snack or indulging in social media 
        applications. Along with distractions and daily obligations, self-care is being  
        neglicted and it's having a negative impact on mood and productivity.  
        Luckily, simple SMS reminders and encouragement can help students and 
        home office workers to get up and get active!
